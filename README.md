This project is part of my [presentation](https://github.com/rezaAdinepour/Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-YoLoV4-Network/blob/main/YOLO-Presentation.pdf) in the Neural Networks course at [Shahrood University of Technology](https://shahroodut.ac.ir/en/)

# You can use this project in two ways
1. Real-Time
2. Offline

# Example for Real-Time method
